# Rusty Billard

A very simple ideal gas simulation with rigid balls bumping into each another, written in Rust.

## How to run

0. Install `rustup`
1. Clone the repo
2. `cargo run`

This should show a histogram which evolves to a Boltzman-Distribution over time.

## ToDo (eventually)

* Use a better algorithm to detect colliding balls with better performance
* ...
